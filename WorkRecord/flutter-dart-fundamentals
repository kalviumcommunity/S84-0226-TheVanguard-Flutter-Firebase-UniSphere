# Flutter & Dart Fundamentals – Counter Demo

## Flutter Architecture

Flutter consists of three layers:

1. Framework Layer (Dart)
   - Material & Cupertino widgets
   - Rendering and animation libraries

2. Engine Layer (C++)
   - Uses Skia rendering engine
   - Handles GPU acceleration and text layout

3. Embedder Layer
   - Connects Flutter to Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop

Flutter renders its own UI instead of using native components, ensuring design consistency.

## StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

### StatelessWidget
- Immutable
- No internal state
- Used for static UI components

### StatefulWidget
- Maintains mutable state
- UI updates dynamically using setState()

---

## Reactive UI in Flutter

When setState() is called:
- The widget is marked dirty
- build() method runs again
- Only affected widgets are rebuilt

UI = f(state)

---

## Why Dart is Ideal for Flutter

- AOT compilation → Native performance
- JIT compilation → Hot Reload
- Strong typing
- Null Safety
- Async/Await support
- Fully object-oriented

---

## Demo Explanation

This project demonstrates:
- Stateless root widget (MyApp)
- Stateful counter screen
- Reactive UI updates using setState()
