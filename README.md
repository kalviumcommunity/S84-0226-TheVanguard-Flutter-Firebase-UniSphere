# 📱 UniSphere  
### Centralized Platform for College Clubs & Student Communities  

---

## 📌 Overview  

**UniSphere** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to simplify how college clubs and student communities manage events, communication, and participation.

Built using **Flutter** and **Firebase**, the platform centralizes registrations, announcements, and attendance tracking into one unified system.

## 🚩 Problem Statement  

College clubs and student communities currently manage:

- 📢 Announcements across scattered platforms  
- 📝 Event registrations through multiple forms  
- 📊 Attendance tracking manually or separately  

This fragmented approach makes coordination inefficient, confusing, and frustrating.

### ❓ How might we centralize event registrations, announcements, and attendance in one place?
